Welcome to my webpage! I'm Dr. Mohammad Selim, a computer science Ph.D. graduate from the University of Kentucky with a research focus on utilizing generative models for image and data synthesis. My journey in computational intelligence began during my BS and MS studies in Software Engineering at the University of Dhaka, leading me to explore innovative applications in healthcare and engineering. Currently, as a postdoctoral ORISE Fellow at the US Food and Drug Administration, I'm passionate about leveraging AI to tackle complex challenges in healthcare and engineering, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and impactful solutions. Let's connect and explore the exciting intersections of technology and real-world problem-solving!
